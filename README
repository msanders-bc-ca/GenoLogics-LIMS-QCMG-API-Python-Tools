    If you are reading this in QCMGProduction/geneus/api/python/glsapi/trunk/  
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
This location is for glsapi.py development work. This means:
a) This is not the place in the repository for scripts.
b) Don't even write scripts against the code here. It isn't guaranteed to be 
   stable, complete, or correct. 

To write scripts against a stable version of glsapi.py, check out a directory from 
https://qcmg-svn.imb.uq.edu.au/svnroot/QCMGProduction/geneus/api/python/scripts/glsapi_version/
and the appropriate branch version of glsapi.py will be pulled into glsapi 
directory via svn:externals

    If you are reading this file elsewhere e.g. glsapi/branches/<branch> or
    scripts/glsapi_version/<version> then it has been carelessly left
    here during a branch or tag copy and should be removed.
