============
INTRODUCTION
============

glsapi.py is:
 a Python module with commonly used functions to access the GenoLogics LIMS Rapid Scripting REST API,
 the first submission to the GenoLogics-LIMS-QCMG-API-Python-Tools open repository, and
 a simple tool when starting to work with the GenoLogics LIMS API in Python

 It was written by Conrad Leonard, PhD at the Queensland Centre for Medical Genomics, Institute for Molecular Bioscience
 in the University of Queensland and supported by other interested script writers using the GenoLogics LIMS products.

==============
Set up and Use
==============

Just like any module, have it in the path or project directory, import it and call the functions.
The primary functions allow you to get, set and create data in the LIMS. Example:

import glsapi as sourceAPI

# set up the api connections strings
sourceURI='http://' + args.sourceIP + ':8080/api/'

sourceAPI.register_service_details(sourceURI, args.sourceUserName, args.sourcePassword)

print "Connecting to Source: " + sourceURI
try:
	result = sourceAPI.get(sourceURI)	
except:
	print 'Source server connection failed: check network and credentials.' 
	sys.exit(1)

# get some data from the api, say the list of defined processes
sourceProcesses = sourceAPI.get('v1/processtypes')

for processElement in sourceProcesses:
	print 'Process defined with name: ' + processElement.get("name") 

====================================
Other Conditions and Considerations
====================================

You need access to a GenoLogics LIMS server hosted somewhere in the world. Contact your university, institute 
or www.genologics.com for more information.

Site Specific QCMG

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
    If you are reading this in QCMGProduction/geneus/api/python/glsapi/trunk/  
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
This location is for glsapi.py development work. This means:
a) This is not the place in the repository for scripts.
b) Don't even write scripts against the code here. It isn't guaranteed to be 
   stable, complete, or correct. 

To write scripts against a stable version of glsapi.py, check out a directory from 
https://qcmg-svn.imb.uq.edu.au/svnroot/QCMGProduction/geneus/api/python/scripts/glsapi_version/
and the appropriate branch version of glsapi.py will be pulled into glsapi 
directory via svn:externals


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
    If you are reading this file elsewhere e.g. glsapi/branches/<branch> or
    scripts/glsapi_version/<version> then it has been carelessly left
    here during a branch or tag copy and should be removed.
