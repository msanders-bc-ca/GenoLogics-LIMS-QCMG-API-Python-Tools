# glsapi.py is:
# a Python module with commonly used functions to access the GenoLogics LIMS Rapid Scripting REST API,
# the first submission to the GenoLogics-LIMS-QCMG-API-Python-Tools open repository, and
# a simple tool when starting to work with the GenoLogics LIMS API in Python
#
# It was written by Conrad Leonard, PhD at the Queensland Centre for Medical Genomics, Institute for Molecular Bioscience
# in the University of Queensland and supported by other interested script writers using the GenoLogics LIMS products.

This location is for glsapi.py development work. This means:
a) This is not the place in the repository for scripts.
b) Don't even write scripts against the code here. It isn't guaranteed to be 
   stable, complete, or correct. 

To write scripts against a stable version of glsapi.py, check out a directory from 
https://qcmg-svn.imb.uq.edu.au/svnroot/QCMGProduction/geneus/api/python/scripts/glsapi_version/
and the appropriate branch version of glsapi.py will be pulled into glsapi 
directory via svn:externals

    If you are reading this file elsewhere e.g. glsapi/branches/<branch> or

    here during a branch or tag copy and should be removed.
