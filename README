============
INTRODUCTION
============

glsapi is:
 a Python package with commonly used functions and scripting classes to access the GenoLogics 
 LIMS Rapid Scripting REST API, the first submission to the 
 GenoLogics-LIMS-QCMG-API-Python-Tools open repository, and a simple tool when starting to 
 work with the GenoLogics LIMS API in Python

 It was written by Conrad Leonard, PhD at the Queensland Centre for Medical Genomics, Institute for Molecular Bioscience
 in the University of Queensland and supported by other interested script writers using the GenoLogics LIMS products.

==============
Set up and Use
==============

Just like any package, have it in the path or project directory, import it and call the functions.
The primary library functions allow you to get, set and create data in the LIMS. Example, assuming
you have a credentials file ~/.geneus/gl_credentials.cfg permissions 600 and containg the line:
exampleserver:::exampleuser:::examplepwd

import sys
from glsapi import glslib as sourceAPI

# set up the api connection
servername = 'exampleserver'
sourceAPI.register(servername)

print("Connecting to Source: " + servername)
try:
	result = sourceAPI.get('/')	
except:
	print('Source server connection failed: check network and credentials.')
	sys.exit(1)

# get some data from the api, say the list of defined processes
sourceProcesses = sourceAPI.get('processtypes')

for processElement in sourceProcesses:
	print('Process defined with name: ' + processElement.get("name")) 

====================================
Other Conditions and Considerations
====================================

You need access to a GenoLogics LIMS server hosted somewhere in the world. Contact your university, institute 
or www.genologics.com for more information.

We would love to have you add and specialize. The following sections are peer repository (site) specific

Site Specific QCMG
===================

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
    If you are reading this in QCMGProduction/geneus/api/python/glsapi/trunk/  
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
This location is for glsapi.py development work. This means:
a) This is not the place in the repository for scripts.
b) Don't even write scripts against the code here. It isn't guaranteed to be 
   stable, complete, or correct. 

To write scripts against a stable version of glsapi.py, check out a directory from 
https://qcmg-svn.imb.uq.edu.au/svnroot/QCMGProduction/geneus/api/python/scripts/glsapi_version/
and the appropriate branch version of glsapi.py will be pulled into glsapi 
directory via svn:externals


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
    If you are reading this file elsewhere e.g. glsapi/branches/<branch> or
    scripts/glsapi_version/<version> then it has been carelessly left
    here during a branch or tag copy and should be removed.
